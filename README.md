The Game

The Smurf Race is a two player game. Movement of the players is triggered by using alternating keys; if you do not press one key first and then the other the smurf character will not move. The game tests the speed of your fingers on the keys and along the way you have to squash the mushrooms on the track in order to get to the finish line. You can tally a score and do best of three to see who is better at racing to the finish line and destroying mushrooms.



How to play

As you press start game player 1 will have to select and character and then player 2 and the game then starts a countdown from three before the race begins and flashes 'GO!'
Player 1 and 2 must repeatedly jump on the mushrooms in order to get to the finish line and win the race.

Once one player has won a score is tallied, the winner is shown and another round can be played by pressing the reset button and the mushrooms will reappear again.

Challenges faced

One of the problems faced when putting this project together was triggering the movement of the one of the players when keys are pressed alternately. If the keys are not pressed alternately then the player will not be able to move.

Another challenge was the collision function as the position of the player and the mushrooms had to be distinguished and then the movement of player has to be stopped until the player has 'squashed' the mushroom in order to have a chance at winning the race.
